# The Great Wooly Data Anonymizer
A beast of burden tasked with masking the whereabouts of all who have walked before it.

## Purpose of the Anonymizer
We'll figure this out later.

## Getting Started
Setup may depend on your machine. I recommend using a virtual environmnet and using pip to install packages within the virtual environment.

1. Install nltk
2. Download the Stanford NER files and place the .gz and .jar file of your choosing in a folder at the root level
