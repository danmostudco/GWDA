Subject: Businessweek interview

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine,

quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.

Subject: Additional PRC Reps and Attending the PRC


We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who
either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a
representative on the Committees.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.

We have also received request from individuals wanting to "observe" the
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' &
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps'
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts'
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene





Mike, Jeff's intent is not that you would interview, but that you would put
the hammer (so to speak!) on some of your people to sign up.

Have a good weekend!  SRS

Dear Neil,

If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at
1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage
visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is
connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to
check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know
you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else be
accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity
to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon;
Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.
If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Neil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house
this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.
In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll
see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Mr. Schaeffer,

Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below.

Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the
current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the

On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for
success.

Subject: Cogent Communications


Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO
